The custom miniplayer made with the help of native code taken from peterscodee. It supports various functionality

1. Ability to appear when someone clicks a button. The widget rebuilds happen when a changeNotifier is clicked
2. It can show a mini as well as a full player, both of which can be indepedently designed
3. The bottom mini-player stays while navigating between screens. It only goes when you push a route naviagtor on top of current navigation tree, but that problem can be handle by putting routnavigator=false
4. The gesture detector along with animation gives the app a spotify type configuratiob. 

# The code isn't UI ready, I made it only for testing purpose to use in another app! But the functionality idea could be taken. I am still experimenting with the code and as a result you will see a lot of print statements and unstructured code. That's just for testing purpose, i will upload the full working code soon and maybe upload it as a package on pub.dev in future!
